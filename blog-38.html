                    <p> Not only is organic food production better for human health and the environment than conventional food production, and yet new research shows what organic champions have long claimed: organic food is more nutritious, in addition to
                        being free of dangerous residues.Including a study released by The Organic Center, organic food contains more total antioxidant capacity, total polyphenols, and two critical flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, all of which are
                        nutritionally valuable.

                        The total phenolic content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn was examined in the Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry, and it was discovered that organically developed items had higher total phenolic content. Phenolics are beneficial to both
                        plant and human health because of their "potent antioxidant activity and wide variety of pharmacologic activities, comprising anticancer, oxidant, and platelet aggregation inhibitory ability."

                        Dairy products from organically raised cattle are also healthier than dairy products from conventionally raised animals, according to studies. In one study, organically produced milk had much greater amounts of beneficial Omega-3s and antioxidants.Antibiotics
                        are not supplied to organically raised animals, but they must graze on organically maintained pastureland or be fed organically grown feed. Some organic milk producers have been cited for violations of the organic standard, illustrating
                        this need finding a local, organic dairy farm and transparent operations.
