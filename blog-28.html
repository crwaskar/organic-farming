                    <p>Plants require a variety of nutrients in varied amounts to thrive. Organic farmers face a challenge in supplying enough nitrogen, particularly synchronisation, so that crops get enough nitrogen when they need it most. Cover crops and
                        green manure ("cover crops") help to provide nitrogen through legumes (specifically, the Fabaceae family), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere in a mutualistic with rhizobial bacteria. Intercropping, which is sometimes utilized
                        for insect and disease control, can help boost soil nutrients, however competition between the legume and the crop can be an issue, necessitating broader crop row spacing.

                        Crop leftovers can be ploughed back into the soil, and various plants leave varied amount of nitrogen in the soil, which might help with synchronizing. Mixture farms with both livestock and crops can operate as ley farms, in which the land acquires fertility
                        by growing nitrogen-fixing fodder grasses like white clover or alfalfa, and then grows cash crops or cereals once the fertility has just been created. Farms without livestock ("stockless") may have a tough time maintaining soil
                        fertility and may rely more on external inputs such imported manure, grain legumes, and green manures, albeit grain legumes may only fix a limited nitrogen related to harvest. Horticultural farms that develop fruits and vegetables
                        in safe conditions rely on external inputs even more frequently. Manure is relatively bulky, and transporting it more than a short distance from the source is frequently not cost-effective. Is there a shortage of manure for organic
                        farms?
