                    <p>Organic farming has been getting more and more attention in recent years as many people look to environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional methods of food production. At first glance, it may seem that these two methods of
                        farming are virtually the same, but there are plenty of ways that organic farming benefits the environment and your health that aren’t so clear at first glance. Here are just five ways organic farming helps make the world a better
                        place by minimizing harm to the environment and promoting healthful, safe food practices.

                        It’s often assumed that organic farming, which focuses on preventing the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and instead uses natural approaches to fertilizing soil and exterminating pests, has to be more expensive than normal farming practices,
                        but this isn’t always the case. Organic farming can actually be quite cost-effective as well as better for the environment and safer for consumers when you look at the long-term benefits of going organic instead of sticking with
                        conventional farming techniques. To learn more about the benefits of organic farming, read on!

                        The idea of organic farming helping to provide food security sounds paradoxical, but it can be the key to fighting one of the biggest issues our world faces today—the challenge of hunger and malnutrition. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
                        Organization (FAO), in 2010 roughly 870 million people went hungry every day, and over 2 billion people lived on less than $1.25 per day. In order to reduce this tragic figure, the FAO suggests that increasing food production through
                        sustainable agricultural practices will be necessary.
