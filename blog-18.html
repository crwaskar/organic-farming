                    <p>As the world population grows and becomes more affluent, the demand for food increases rapidly, straining our current food systems and leading to ever-higher prices at the supermarket. While agribusiness has helped to improve farming’s
                        productivity, this comes at a cost of reduced biodiversity and increased use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Could organic farming be an alternative? What are its implications on food security?

                    <p>
                        Organic farming is becoming increasingly popular throughout the world, with more and more people looking to it as an alternative solution to the industrial farming model. Proponents of organic farming point to its ability to reduce costs in terms of energy
                        and labor, as well as the fact that it uses fewer resources such as water and fertilizer than conventional methods of food production, making it more sustainable in the long run. Yet others point out that these are not enough reasons
                        to pursue this kind of agriculture, questioning the effectiveness of organic farming in achieving food security and whether adopting it would even be possible worldwide given the current infrastructure surrounding food production.

                        Organic farming has been getting more and more attention in recent years as many people look to environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional methods of food production. At first glance, it may seem that these two methods of farming are virtually
                        the same, but there are plenty of ways that organic farming benefits the environment and your health that aren’t so clear at first glance. Here are just five ways organic farming helps make the world a better place by minimizing
                        harm to the environment and promoting healthful, safe food practices.
