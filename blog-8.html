                    <p>Sustainability is concerned with meeting current needs without jeopardising future generations' ability to meet their own. It involves the total health of society, and it is our responsibility to continue to examine the long-term consequences
                        of our activities.

                        Throughout the developed and developing worlds, we live in a modern, consumerist, and largely urban society, consuming huge amounts of natural resources on a daily basis. Every year, we are predicted to utilize around 40% more resources than we can replenish.
                        Sustainable development and sustainability are concerned with balancing opposing needs, such as our desire to advance technologically and economically while also safeguarding the environment.

                        Understanding why you're buying something in the first place is key to wise purchase. If you're buying for a purely materialistic need like prestige or identification rather than a necessity, consider whether the environmental and resource expenditure
                        is worthwhile. Conscious consumption is the order of the day, with the foundation of Minimalist Living being "to simplify." To have less possessions. "I want to be free."
