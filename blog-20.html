                    <p>More than 800 million people worldwide do not have enough food to lead healthy, active lives. In fact, nearly half of the world’s countries are affected by hunger and malnutrition in some form or another. With roughly one person in
                        eight suffering from chronic undernourishment, it’s clear that the fight against hunger and malnutrition needs to be met with an effective solution; and luckily, that solution may already exist. Organic farming may be the key to
                        sustainable food security. Learn how organic farming can help to secure food sources here...

                        Organic farming uses natural fertilizers, such as manure, compost, or nitrogen-fixing plants, to feed the soil rather than synthetic ones. It does not allow genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in any part of the production process, and it doesn’t use
                        chemical pesticides. Organic farms are also more likely to have diversity in their landscapes—they include flowers and flowering trees to attract beneficial insects that help keep pests away from crops.

                        The world’s population continues to grow, with estimates of 9 billion people on Earth by 2050, putting increased pressure on food security. In addition, climate change and natural disasters threaten to decrease crop yields and global food security. Organic
                        farming may be the answer to sustainable food production, as well as many of the world’s environmental issues, but more research is needed to fully understand its role in food security.
