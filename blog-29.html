                    <p>The findings of yield correlations have already been varied. These discrepancies sometimes can be linked to variances in study designs, such as differences in the crops studied and the methodology used to collect data. Including a
                        2012 meta-analysis, organic agricultural productivity is usually lower than conventional farming, but the extent of the difference varies on context and can be quite tiny in some instances. While organic yields can be lower than
                        conventional yields, a 2015 meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research showed that certain organic on-farm methods could help close the gap. The use of timely herbicides and the application of manure in conjunction
                        with legume forages/cover crops has been known to increase organic corn and soybean productivity.

                        . On a test farm at the Rodale Institute for 22 years, a survey published in 2005 contrasted conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping. "Crop yields for maize and soybeans were equal in the organic animal,
                        organic legume, and traditional farming systems," according the study. It was also observed that "The Rodale Institute's organic livestock and organic legume systems used much less fossil energy to produce corn than the traditional
                        system. There was little change in energy input across the various grain regimes. Chemical fertilizer and insecticides were rarely employed in organic systems ".. The Rodale study was still continuing in 2013 and Rodale published
                        a thirty-year reunion report in 2012.
