                    <p> Organic farms can only be certified after 3 years of operation following organic principles. However, because the term "organic" is not regulated in Australia, it is essential to guarantee that the items you buy are grown and prepared
                        by certified farmers. Prior to 2009, there was no standard (guidelines and norms) for domestic and imported organic foods.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, the phrase "organic" was misrepresented in the Australian domestic food market. In Australia, the production, processing, and labelling of organic food have currently governed by two major criteria. These are the ones that follow: The National
                        Organics and Biodynamic Produce Standard (for exported foods) The Australian Organic and Biodynamic Product Standard (for domestic and imported foods). These guidelines establish a series of practises that must be followed in the
                        manufacturing of organic food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ensures the integrity and traceability of organic food from "paddock to plate." In Australia, the law covers the development, preparation, transit, marketing, and labelling of organic products. While it is required for exported organic produce to
                        be certified and fulfil the National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce, the Australian standard (for both domestic and imported items) is voluntary. Its purpose is to help the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
                        (ACCC) confirm that claims made concerning organic and biodynamic products are factual.
