                        For organic farmers, sustainability isn’t just something that happens at the end of the day or in a few months—it’s something they work towards every day, from the seeds they plant to the harvest they gather. Organic farming not only helps keep soil fertile
                        and water clean, but it also benefits farmers, consumers, and communities around the world by reducing environmental damage and protecting human health. By making sustainable choices such as choosing organic over conventional foods,
                        people can play their part in keeping the planet green! Here are some of the top advantages of organic farming that support sustainability.

                        Although organic farming still represents only a small percentage of total agricultural production in the United States, it’s quickly growing in popularity as more and more people turn to it to support their health and the environment. Organic farmers
                        don’t use harmful pesticides or herbicides and they don’t use GMOs (genetically modified organisms) or antibiotics on their crops, making their farms natural, sustainable places where wildlife can flourish and farmers can grow
                        food while reducing their impact on the planet.
