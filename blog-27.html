                    <p>Traditional farming approaches are based on naturally occurring biological processes are combined with modern science of ecology and some modern technology in organic farming systems. In the discipline of agroecology, organic farming
                        methods are investigated. Organic farmers are required by law to use natural fertilizer and pesticides, whereas conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically refined agrochemicals. Pyrethrin,
                        which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower, is an example of a natural pesticide. Crop rotation, green manures and compost, biological crop protection, and mechanical cultivation are all important aspects of organic farming.

                        The natural environment is used to boost agricultural output: legumes are planted to fix ammonia into the soil, natural pest predators are promoted, crops be rotated to confuse parasites and replenish soil, and natural insect predators are fostered. While
                        organic and large-scale conventional farming are fundamentally different from each other due to the use of carbon-based soils rather than highly soluble synthetic fertilisers and biological pesticide application rather than synthetic
                        pesticides, they are not mutually incompatible. Many of the organic agriculture methods have been adapted by more conventional crops. For examples, Integrated Pest Management is a comprehensive strategy that uses various chemical
                        pest management tactics wherever possible, but only uses synthetic pesticides as a last resort in conventional farming.
