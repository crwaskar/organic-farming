                    <p> In organic farming, it is important to maintain a healthy soil that is rich in organic matter and contains all of the nutrients plants obtain. To raise soil fertility, a variety of procedures such as green manuring, manure addition,
                        and biofertilizers can be used.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These organic sources still provide additional nutrients to the soil, but they also help to avoid weeds and produce soil organic matter, and feeds soil microorganisms. Plant residues soil resists soil erosion, stores water better, and thus requires less
                        irrigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Natural minerals that plants take for growth and to improve the consistency of the soil can also be added. To restore the pH balance of the soil, soil fertilizers such as lime can be used. Heavy metals should be kept to a minimum in soil amendments and
                        water. The majority of the biofertilizers utilised are waste by-products from other operations that would otherwise be thrown away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Animal dung and mushroom compost are used by farmers to generate compost. Compost is heated and composted for at least two months before being spread to the fields, generating and maintaining an indoor climate of 130°-140°F to remove unfavorable bacteria
                        and weed seeds. Organic farming can use a variety of organic fertilizers/amendments, as well as bacterial and fungal biofertilizers, depending on availability and crop viability.
