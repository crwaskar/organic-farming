                    <p>In forests, weed control measures are intended to promote the growth of preferred tree species, improve visibility along forest roads, reduce noxious weeds, and improve wildlife habitats. The purpose is to manage tree species, as well
                        as the ground beneath them. Each component, such as plants and fauna, is maximised while remaining balanced. The primary means of achieving a productive forest is through vegetation control. Managers must incorporate the best cultural,
                        mechanical, and chemical techniques into their operations. To reduce weed-related losses and negative impacts, invest in appropriate and cost-effective management systems.

                        A forester might go out on a weed-control mission with one or more of the following goals in mind: Removing undesirable vegetation from planting locations to make room for the trees that have been planted. More desirable species are released from less
                        desirable overtopping species. Excess plants in a stand are being thinned out. Using root grafts to prevent disease spread. Keeping herbaceous and/or woody vegetation out of recreational areas and wildlife refuges. Vegetation control
                        along forest routes and around structures and facilities.

                        Brush rakes, angle blades, shearing blades, rolling brush cutters, and shredders are among the specialised machines and attachments used in forest vegetation management. Occasionally, large offset discs and integral ploughs are employed. Weeding can also
                        be done with chainsaws, axes, brush hooks, motorised brush cutters, hatchets, and other hand tools. Mechanical site preparation and rehabilitation on gentle slopes is usually adequate to remove trash, control weeds, prepare seedbeds,
                        minimise soil compaction caused by logging, and perform modest land levelling operations.
