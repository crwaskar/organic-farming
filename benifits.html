                        Long-term viability is important. Many environmental changes are long-term and occur gradually over time. Organic agriculture analyses the agro-medium- ecosystem's and long-term effects of agricultural activities. Its goal is to generate food while maintaining
                        an ecological balance to avoid difficulties with soil fertility or pests. Organic agriculture offers a preventative strategy rather than reacting to problems as they arise.

                        Soil. Crop rotations, intercropping, symbiotic relationships, cover crops, organic fertilizers, and minimal tillage are all important soil-building techniques in organic farming. These improve soil development and structure while also producing more stable
                        systems by encouraging soil fauna and flora. As a result, nutrient and energy cycling improves, and the soil's nutrient and water retentive properties improve, making up for the lack of mineral fertilizers. Soil erosion control
                        benefits greatly from such management strategies. The amount of time the soil is exposed to erosive pressures is reduced, soil biodiversity is increased, and nutrient losses are reduced, all of which contribute to the maintenance
                        and enhancement of soil productivity. Crop nutrient export is normally compensated by farm-derived renewable resources, but it may be necessary in particular cases.

                        Water. Pollution of groundwater courses by synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is a big issue in many agricultural areas. Because their usage is restricted in organic agriculture, organic fertilizers (e.g. compost, animal manure, green manure) and increased
                        biodiversity (in terms of cultivated species and permanent plants) are used to improve soil structure and water infiltration. Groundwater contamination is considerably reduced by well-managed organic systems with superior nutrient
                        retentive properties. Conversion to organic agriculture is heavily advocated as a remedial solution in some locations where pollution is a serious issue (e.g. by the Governments of France and Germany).
