                    <p> The utilization of synthetic pesticides is heavily reliant on plant protection in conventional agriculture. Crop rotation, intercropping, resistant cultivars, biological treatment using natural enemies, good hygiene, and other measures,
                        on the other hands, are widely used in organic farming for plant protection.

                    <p>
                        However, certain pesticides are permitted in organic farming. Pesticides (in this example, chemical plant-protection products; micro- and macrobiological agents are not included in this discussion due to their low importance for human health) are certified
                        in the EU after a comprehensive review, which includes a variety of toxicological tests in animal studies. Acceptable residue quantities in food are calculated using the same documentation and expected concentrations for pesticides
                        that have been approved for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most pesticides approved for organic agriculture are of low toxicological concern for consumers because they are not interconnected to any through as (e.g. spearmint oil, quartz sand), because they are part of a normal diet or contain human nutrients
                        (e.g. iron, potassium bicarbonate, rapeseed oil), or because they are only approved for use in insect traps and will have a low risk of entering the food chain (e.g. iron, potassium bicarbonate, rapes (i.e. the synthetic pyrethroids
                        lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, and pheromones). Pyrethrins and copper are 2 major exceptions. Pyrethrins, a plant extract from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, operate the same way as synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, also
                        they are less stables
