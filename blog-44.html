                    <p> Because a significant range of toxicological effects are addressed in animal and other experimental investigations, the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides now used in the EU is comprehensive. Nonetheless, there are concerns that
                        this risk assessment is insufficient in addressing mixed exposures, particularly in terms of carcinogenic effects endocrine disruption, and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, there are worries that test protocols lag behind independent
                        science, that independent scientific studies are not fully considered, and that data gaps are often accepted.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These worries are mostly about the long-term consequences of exposure and the tall impacts of acute exposure, which are more difficult to detect than the short-term effects. The overall health advantages of eating a lot of fruits and vegetables have been
                        widely proven. These benefits, however, may be harmed by pesticide residues, as evidenced by recent findings for affects on sperm quality. Inverse confounding occurs when the advantages of a contamination are countered by a pollutant,
                        which can be difficult to control for.

                    <p>
                        Of course, the possible detrimental health effects of dietary pesticide residues should not be used to justify a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption. Nutrient content should not be used to justify pesticide exposure. Exposures associated with
                        traditional agricultural production (i.e. occupational or drift exposure from spraying) have been linked to an elevated risk of certain diseases, including Parkinson's disease.
