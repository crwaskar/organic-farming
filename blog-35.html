                    <p> In organic farming, pest presence (where and when) is predicted beforehand so, and planting timings and locations are adapted as necessary to avoid major pest problems. To tackle dangerous pests, the most important way is to increase
                        the population of beneficial insects, whose larvae feed on pest eggs. Setting borders (host crops) across fields planted with flowering plant mixtures that the helpful insects prefer is critical to growing a community of beneficial
                        insects.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, on a daily basis, beneficial insects are released into the fields, where its host crops serve as a home base for all of them and, over time, attract more beneficial insects. When a pest epidemic cannot be controlled by beneficial insects, natural
                        or organically approved insecticides, such as neem pesticides, are used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Low toxicity to humans and animals, as well as low persistence in the environment, are the 2 major characteristics for organic pesticides. The National Agricultural Standards provide several standards.
