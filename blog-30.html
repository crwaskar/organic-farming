                    <p>In India, organic farming still in its infancy. According to the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, about 2.78 million hectares of farmland were under organic agriculture in March 2020. This comprises 2% of the country's
                        total net sown area of 140.1 million ha. Because a large portion of organic farming is concentrated in only a few states, a few states have taken the lead in increasing funding. Madhya Pradesh is at the top of the list, with 0.76
                        million acres under organic cultivation, making for about a third of India's total organic cultivation area. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra make up roughly half of the total area under crop production.

                        The top ten states account for the vast majority of the overall. Organic farming contributes for 10% or more of the net planted area in a few states, including Meghalaya, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Sikkim. Exception of Goa, all of these states are
                        positioned in hilly areas. Organic food covers 10% or more of the net cultivation area in Union Territories including Delhi, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, and Chandigarh, while their agricultural area is incredibly
                        small. Almost everything other states have organic farming covering less than 10% of their net sown area.
