                    <p> The organic food business in Australia is rising. The organic market was predicted to be worth at least $2.6 billion in retail in 2019, having 1.9 billion in domestic sales and $6.9 billion in exports. Since 2012, Australia has recorded
                        a compound annual growth rate of 13%. Organic food demand is increasing at a pace of 20â€“30 percent per year. More than six out of ten Australian households now purchase organic goods on a regular basis. Fruit and vegetables, meat,
                        non-alcoholic beverages, nuts, and ready-to-eat foods all are popular items.

                        Why should you buy organic food?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The number of shoppers purchase organically raised food but they are concerned about pesticides, additives, antibiotics, and other chemical residues, and they believe organic food is healthier. Concerns about just the impact of conventional farming on
                        biodiversity and the environment, as well as the ethical treatment of animals, are among those factors.

                        Food ethics and organic farming
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Organic foods encourage more sympathetic treatment of animals also while giving hormone- and salmonella meat. Furthermore, some consumers are interested in the long health, economic, and environmental impacts of genetically modified crops, and opt for
                        organic products to support an industry that does not utilise Available technology.
