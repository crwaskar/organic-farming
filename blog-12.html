                    <p>In organic farming, it is critical to maintain a healthy soil that is rich in organic matter and contains all of the nutrients required by the plants. To increase soil fertility, a variety of techniques such as green manuring, manure
                        addition, and biofertilizers can be used. These organic sources not only provide additional nutrients to the soil, but they also help to avoid weeds and enhance soil organic matter, which feeds soil microorganisms. Organic matter-rich
                        soil resists soil erosion, stores water better, and thus requires less irrigation. Natural minerals that plants require to develop and improve the consistency of the soil can also be added.

                        Heavy metals should be kept to a minimum in soil amendments and water. The majority of the natural manure utilized are waste by-products from other businesses that would otherwise be thrown away. Animal dung and mushroom compost are also used by farmers
                        to generate compost. Compost is heated and aged for at least two months before being spread to the fields, achieving and maintaining an interior temperature of 130°-140°F to destroy undesired bacteria and weed seeds.

                        Due to the poor nutritional content of commonly accessible and applied farm yard manure (FYM) and vermicompost, substantial application rates are required to meet crop nutrient requirements. However, in many developing nations, particularly India, organic
                        manures are in short supply, mainly due to the country's substantial usage of animal dung in energy production. Green manuring with Sesbania, cowpea, green gramme, and other legumes is very successful in increasing soil organic
