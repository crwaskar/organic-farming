                    <p>Agriculture, along with its linked sectors, is India's most important source of income, with 70 percent of rural people relying on it as their primary source of income, and 82 percent of farmers being small and marginal. Due to its
                        enormous potential for value addition, the Indian food industry is poised for significant expansion, increasing its contribution to the global food trade every year. The Indian food and grocery market is the world's sixth largest,
                        with retail accounting for 70% of total sales. In terms of technology, infrastructure, government backing, and education, India is fast developing, which has benefited Indian farmers in a variety of ways.

                        The logistics industry's scope has expanded beyond basic goods transportation to include end-to-end supply chain solutions, warehousing, and express delivery, thanks to the developing Indian economy and changing corporate attitudes. Truck movement is
                        more faster than it has ever been, enhancing the product's consum-ability within its shelf life.

                        Unlike previous generations of Indian farmers, today's farmers are not stereotyped as "Kisans" (farmer). They are technologically knowledgeable and eager to accept new technology that will help them increase their earnings. For example, Hello Kisan has
                        422k subscribers on YouTube, and Farmer Leader has 2 million subscribers. The Farmer's Market, a Facebook group with over 25,000 members, has become a popular place for farmers to seek aid or advise from one another.
