                    <p>Agriculture has really been practised without the use of artificial chemicals for thousands of years. Artificial fertilisers were invented in the half century. These early fertilisers were inexpensive, practical, and easy to transport
                        in large quantities. In the 1940s, similar innovations in chemical pesticides occurred, earning the decade the moniker "pesticide age." While these new agricultural techniques were advantageous in the short term, they had much
                        that disadvantages such as compaction, erosion, and overall soil fertility reductions, as well as health concerns about toxic substances entering the supply of food. : 10 Soil biology scientists began trying to find solutions to
                        mitigate these bad impacts while maintaining higher production levels in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Albert Howard, the founder and predecessor of the organic movement, and his wife Gabrielle Howard, both excellent botanists,
                        created the Institute of Plant Industry in India in 1921 to improve ancient farming systems.

                        They best functionality implements and improved animal husbandry practises from their scientific expertise, and then devised protocols for crop rotation, erosion prevention strategies, and the systematic use of composts and manures by incorporating features
                        of Indian traditional systems. As Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s. he felt inspired by his traditional farming experiences & began to support an organic farming system.
