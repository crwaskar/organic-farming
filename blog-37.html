                    <p> Farmworkers and their families are the population groups most affected by pesticide use. These persons reside in areas where hazardous pesticides are applied, and pesticide drift and water damage are prevalent. Pesticides are exceedingly
                        common by farmworkers, both pesticide applicators and fieldworkers who tend to and harvest the crops.

                    <p>
                        These toxins are then handed on to their families and children through contact with them and their clothing. Inadvertently, pregnant women working in the fields expose their unborn children to harmful chemicals. Organic agriculture minimizes the use of
                        these harmful chemicals, removes a major risk to human health for employees, their families, and their communities. For farmworker pesticide poisonings, there is no national reporting method. According to the publication Fields
                        of Poison 2002: California Farmworkers and Pesticides, were there 475 confirmed farmworker related deaths from pesticides in the years 1997-2000 in California, one of the few states that required reporting pesticide poisonings.

                        As discussed in the paper, this likely undercounts the true number of poisonings because many cases go unreported for a variety of reasons, including rising health-care costs, which have expanded reluctance to seek treatment, medical professional misdiagnosis,
                        and insurance companies' failure to forward reports to appropriate people. Acute pesticide poisonings for farmworkers are exactly one feature of pesticide exposure's health repercussions. Many farmworkers spend years in the field,
                        exposed to toxic substances, and some studies have found that farmworkers have an expanded danger of some malignancies. Another lengthy biological effect of pesticide exposure is shown by latest research on endocrine disrupting
                        poisons.
