                    <p>As we all know, onions are one of the most commonly used veggies in any kitchen. The list will continue on and on with veggie curry, biryani, soup, salads, burgers, and so on. Onion offers a particular flavour to a meal thanks to its
                        pungent strong flavor. Whether you use crispy fried onions as a spice or a smooth paste for gravy, the end result is sure to please.

                        Dehydrated onion is a dried form of fresh onion that has exploded in popularity in the culinary business, and for good cause. Dehydrated onions have a concentrated flavor that enhances the overall flavor of any gourmet dish that asks for onions in its
                        preparation. Multiple processes are used to turn the light and pungent onions into a tasty and easy-to-use component.

                        Dehydrated onions are now widely accessible in supermarkets, and an increasing number of individuals are opting for them. They're a handy staple that may be used in a variety of ways. You won't have to peel or cut them, and you won't have to worry about
                        storing them. It has a longer shelf life and can be stored without refrigeration for a long time. I'm curious if these can be used in place of fresh onions and vice versa. Yes, it is correct. The two types of onions can be substituted
                        for one another. However, a minor color, flavor, or texture variance cannot be excluded out.
