                    <p>When you buy organic food, you’re avoiding the use of pesticides and other chemicals in your meals, which helps to promote better health and lower the risk of disease. But what about when it comes to organic farming itself? How are
                        farms certified as organic? What does organic mean in this context? This guide to the truth about organic farming and organic food will answer all your questions about what goes into producing your favorite healthy foods, whether
                        they’re grown by conventional or organic farmers.

                        If you’re in the market for organic food, whether to lose weight or make sure your family stays healthy, you may have heard about the evils of conventional farming and synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. The truth is that not all organic foods are created
                        equal, and some aren’t worth their higher price tag. Learn what organic means, how it affects the price of food, and how to choose the healthiest organic foods at the supermarket.

                        Organic farming has become an industry of its own, and even non-organic farmers are jumping on the bandwagon to sell their wares as certified organic or 100% natural. But what do these terms really mean? Organic farmers can’t use synthetic fertilizers
                        or pesticides, but they do still use plenty of additives, preservatives, and even genetically modified organisms (GMOs). And don’t think that just because you buy something labeled organic that it means it was grown in healthy
                        soil with healthy plants—it may not have been!
