                    <p> Biodynamic farming was conceived by Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner but is a sort of organic farming. It combines traditional agricultural methods and prescribed preparations, with a significant focus on ecological harmony and
                        sustainable development. Composts, preparations, and natural activating elements can be used to grow biodynamic food. Biodynamic foods are covered by national organic certification in Australia.
