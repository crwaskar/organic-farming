                    <p> As part of our social responsibility, Agronic Food partnered with Seva Mandir, a non-profit organization based in Udaipur, Rajasthan that works mostly in tribal communities to secure the education of children aged 6 to 14. Half of
                        the children in the rural areas of southern Rajasthan where Seva Mandir operates do not attend school, and a third have never had access to it. They might use Seva Mandir to lobby the government for greater educational facilities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seva Mandir builds Shiksha Kendras, which are single classrooms with one or two instructors, depending on the classroom's size, that provide education to children up to the third grade. These are transitional schools where students who have never been
                        exposed to educational institutions can graduate and apply for secondary school. They also have basic medical treatment and are tracked in the event of an absence, which helps to avoid the problem of pupils only attending school
                        on a periodic basis in rural locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Agronomic Food has been financially supporting the organization's operations for the past three years. We visit the classrooms on a regular basis to meet the students and assess their progress. Aside from these activities, the Shiksha Kendras provide
                        us with half-yearly audit reports on how many students have graduated, how many students have attended lessons, and how many students are taking classes at any given moment. The current Shiksha Kendra has 55 children enrolled,
                        and over 200 students have graduated from the Kendra that we assist, allowing them to enter the formal education system.
