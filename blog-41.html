                    <p> A large body of studies aims to characterise individual lifestyles, motivations, and dietary patterns in relation to organic food usage, as measured by responses to food frequency questionnaires. However, as compared to other nutritional
                        epidemiology areas, current research on the role of organic food consumption in human health is limited. Long-term interventional studies focused on identifying potential links between organic food consumption and health are particularly
                        scarce, owing to the high costs of doing that and.

                        Although compliance rating is tough, prospective cohort studies are a promising method to evaluate such correlations. Because there are no biomarkers for exposure, the evaluation of exposure, such as organic food intake, will have to focus on self-reported
                        data, that might be vulnerable to measurement error.

                        Recent reviews have reported the results of clinical research investigating the link between organic food diet and health. These studies are scarce, and most of them are based on small populations and limited time periods, limiting statistical power in
                        order to detect long-term results. Overall, there are still no clinically significant variations in biomarkers related to health or nutritional status between volunteers feeding organic food and controls having conventional food,
                        so according evidence from preclinical studies. The plant-based part of the diets was supplied in controlled field trials in the OrgTrace cross-over intervention study of 33 males, however 12 days of intervention demonstrated no
                        effect of the production system on the overall intake .
