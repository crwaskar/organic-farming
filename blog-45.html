                        tolerate roughly 0.3 mg of turmeric (WHO ) Too much turmeric in the body can cause adverse effects such as diarrhea, allergic reactions, and can harm our internal organs.

                        Turmeric finger supplements should only be taken if a doctor prescribes them for a specific cause, such as medicine or blood thinners. Negative side effects can occur if you take the turmeric supplement without first consulting a doctor. Let's have a
                        look at how much turmeric the average person should consume on a daily basis. To function normally, the human body requires 0.3 mg to 0.5 mg of turmeric. It will strengthen our immune system and reduce inflammation.
