                    <p>There are currently 263 Agromet observatories, 42 Evapotranspiration Stations, 43 Soil Moisture Stations, and 76 Dew gauge stations in the country's network of agrometeorology observatories. The Agrometeorology division of the Indian
                        Meteorological Department (IMD) is collaborating with these observatories to build a suitable National network of Agromet Observatories for effective use of real-time agromet data in Agromet Advisory Services (AAS). All observatories
                        will be able to access agromet data from their own station, as well as data from other stations, over this national network.

                        Weather scientists, operational meteorologists, the aviation/transport industry, and policymakers all rely heavily on real-time weather forecasting. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing's (C-DAC) Computational Earth Science (CES) group has
                        created "Anuman," an automated workflow for real-time weather simulations based on the National Center of Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model.

                        Agricultural universities, research institutes, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been producing a plethora of technology to help farmers increase their production and profitability. Farmers, on the other hand, face a knowledge gap, with those who have access
                        to information reaping higher earnings.
