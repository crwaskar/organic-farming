                    <p>On May 4, 2022, Congressman David Scott, U.S. Representative for Georgia's 13th District and Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, visited the Rodale Institute Southeast Organic Center to discuss the role of regenerative organic
                        agriculture in strengthening the nation's food supply and to highlight research being conducted within Rodale Institute's network of farms.

                        In the year leading up to the 2023 Farm Bill, Congressman Scott, as Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, is a key policy maker fighting to develop regenerative organic agriculture. Following its passage, the Farm Bill establishes federal agriculture
                        policy for the next five to 10 years. Many broken aspects of our society, such as social inequity, human health epidemics, supply chain disruptions, and climate change, can be addressed through regenerative organic agriculture.
                        CheFarmer Matthew Raiford (Co-Owner of Strong Roots 9, Gilliard Farms, and Board Chair for Georgia Organics), Steve Nygren (Serenbe Founder & CEO), and numerous local farmers joined Congressman Scott at the Southeast Organic Center.

                        “It was a pleasure meeting with the farmers and researchers right here in my district, who are at the tip of the spear when it comes to regenerative organic agriculture,” stated Congressman David Scott. “American families rely on agricultural infrastructure
                        for their produce and groceries every day, and it is imperative for our nation’s food supply that we continue to implement policy at the federal level that not only bolsters sustainable farming practices, but also mitigates the
                        effects of climate change.”
